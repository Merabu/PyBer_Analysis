# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
In this project, I was asked by a Decision maker at PyBer to use my python skills and knowledge of panda and knowledge of pandas to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and then use pandas and matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. And write a report on the findings  for the PyBer analysis

## Results:

The average fare per ride in rural areas are greater.

The average fare per driver in rural areas are greater too.
