# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
In this project, I was asked by a decision maker at PyBer to use my python skills and knowledge of panda to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and then use pandas and matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. And write a report on the findings  for the PyBer analysis

## Results:
### PyBer - Multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type image_name

The total number of drivers in rural areas is much less compared to urban and suburan

The average fare per ride in rural areas are greater.

The average fare per driver in rural areas are greater too.

The total fare in urban areas are more.


## Summary

Urban fare totals are much bigger than Suburban  and surbauran fares are bigger than Rural.
There is a similiarity in the partner over the mothns of Janurary 2019 and may-2019.
The gragh shows the highest fares at the end of febuary and March. 
 From my analysis more drivers in the rural area can lower down the average fare per ride and
increase revenue for PyBer. More driver driver in suburban area can bring the
average fare per ride down and increase total revenue for PybBer
